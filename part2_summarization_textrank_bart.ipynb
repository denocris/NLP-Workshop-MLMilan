using TextRank and BART (see the slides for details).\n","In the first section we build our own version of TextRank from scratch. BART is a big and complicated model, since we don't have time and resources to write the code and train the model in the second part we \"simply\" use two BART models already fine-tuned on summarization datasets to generate summaries starting from different input texts.<br>\n","Disclaimer: the code is very verbose and inefficient, it has been written so that everyone can understand it. Feel free to rewrite it in a nicer and more efficient way (see exercise 1 of TextRank section). <br><br>\n","I suggest to activate the GPU (on Colab: Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU) for faster inference when using BART."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zaqEoJJfljiy","colab_type":"code","outputId":"17cb53b1-9ca3-49a0-d7aa-aac3963c9560","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1589972162130,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":10838,"user":{"displayName":"Andrea

The markets have come under extra scrutiny following the coronavirus outbreak.\n","While supermarkets selling chilled or frozen meats are increasingly popular in Asia, older shoppers generally prefer buying freshly slaughtered meat for daily consumption, believing it produces flavour in dishes and soup that is superior to frozen meat. Slabs of beef and pork hang from the butchers’ stalls while various cuts are piled on the counters amid lights with a reddish glare and the occasional buzzing of flies. After widespread avian flu outbreaks in the late 1990s however, Hong Kong and many Chinese provinces have banned the sale of live poultry in markets.\n","While “wet markets”, where water is sloshed on produce to keep it cool and fresh, may be considered unsanitary by western standards, most do not trade in exotic or wild animals and should not be confused with “wildlife markets” – now the focus of vociferous calls for global bans.\n","The now-infamous Wuhan South China seafood market, suspected to be a primary source for spreading Covid-19 in late 2019, had a wild animal section where live and slaughtered species were for sale, including snakes, beavers, badgers, civet cats, foxes, peacocks and porcupines among other animals.\n","The Wuhan market was closed in January and the Chinese authorities placed a temporary ban on all trade in wildlife. But according to recent news reports, some wildlife markets in southern China have reopened amid the pandemic, selling dogs, cats, bats, lizards and scorpions among other species.\n","Many Chinese continue to believe in the health benefits of consuming meat from wild animals. Two leading Hong Kong microbiologists, Professor Yuen Kwok-yung and Dr David Lung, last month condemned the continuing practice of consuming wild game, warning that “Sars 3” could materialise if people do not refrain from eating wild animals.\"\"\""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NOoIMWayIHWs","colab_type":"code","outputId":"9bbeabda-efa9-4d80-ca41-f61c5476da51","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1589972946446,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":8685,"user":{"displayName":"Andrea
